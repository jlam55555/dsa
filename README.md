Playground and working examples for data structures and algorithms

(e.g., canned algorithms for LeetCode contests)

---

### Usage:

Run a specific example:
```bash
$ make run_knapsack_01
```
(A runnable example directory must have a `main()` function and a `_depends.txt` file listing all dependencies). Other directories may simply be data structure implementations w/o driver code.

Cleanup:
```bash
$ make clean
```
